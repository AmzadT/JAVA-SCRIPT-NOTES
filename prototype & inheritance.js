// Session Goals
// How inheritance makes coding efficient
// How do we achieve Inheritance in Js
// Object.create() method
// Everything in Js is object
// Prototype chain
// Prototype method available on the constructor function
// Difference between proto and prototype
// Creating your own array library
//  What is a prototype?
// A blueprint
// An original object from which a new object is created.
// What is inheritance?
// In simple terms, inheritance is the concept of one thing gaining the properties or behaviors of something else.

// To say A inherits from B, is saying that A is a type of B.

// a Bird inherits from an Animal because a Bird is a type of Animal - it has characteristics of every other animal, but other features as well.

//  Why Inheritance?
// It allows us to borrow properties and function methods of one object on another object. ( Inheritance )
// more reusable code
// How to use Prototypal Inheritance in Js?
// There are two ways.


// 1. Object.create()

// 2. Constructor functions
