// keywords to declare a variable let, var and const.

let a;  // decalare a variable
a = 5;  // assigning a value to the variable

let x = 10;  // decalre and assign the value in the same line

// console.log(a);
// console.log(x);


var sum = 20;
// console.log(sum);
var name = "Amzad"; // "1" -- > if I write anything inside that ("") it is always a string.


const variable = "Hello";
console.log(variable)



// Difference :-

// const
 // const a = 5; // declaring and const is same otherwise you will get error but you do it with let and var

 let name  = "Masai";
 name = "school" // reassigning the variable name
// console.log(name)


const place = "Delhi";
place = "Goa" // you can reassign the variable declare with const, but we can do with let and var
// console.log(place)



// diff between let and var

// try to use always let

// scope global, local and block


// let vs var

// console.log(a)
// var a = 5; // intialize and assign value

// console.log(a)
// let a = 5;
